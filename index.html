            <h3>I received a job offer mid-course, and the subjects I learned were current, if not more so, in the company I joined. I honestly feel I got every penny's worth.</h3>

            <p class="text">"I was an EMT for many years beforeI joined the bootcamp. I've been looking to make a transition and have heard some people who had an amazing experience here. I signed up for the free intro course and found it incredibly fun! I enrolled shortly thereafter. The next 12 weeks was the best - and most grueling - time of my life. Since completing the course, I've successfully switched careers, working as a Software Engineer at a VR startup."</p>

The program gave me the confidence necessary to be able to go out in the world and present myself as a capable junior developer. The standard is above the rest. You will get the personal attention you need from an incredible community of smart and amazing people."</p>

            <h3>Such a life-changing experience. Highly recommended!</h3>
            <p class="text">"Before joining the bootcamp, I've never written a line of code. I needed some structure form professionals who can help me learn programming step by step. I was encouraged to enroll by a former student of theirs who can only say wonderful things about the program. The entire curriculum and staff did not disapoint. They were very hand-on and i never had to wait long for assistance. The agile team project, in particular, was outsanding. It took my learning to the next level in a way that no tutorial could ever have. In fact , i have often referred to it during interviews as an example of my development experience. It certainly helped me land a job as a full-stack developper after receiving multiple offers. 100% recommend!"</p>
